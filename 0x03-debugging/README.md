this project talks about debugging

0. Multiple mains: You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
1. Like, comment, subscribe: You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
2. 0 > 972?: Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3. Leap year: Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
